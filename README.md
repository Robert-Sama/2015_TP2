Data structures
Fall 2023
In this TP, you will implement two different Map classes to serve basic natural language
processing (NLP) functions. Particularly, you will constitute datasets of numerous documents.
You will use the first Map to store the words of these documents (Word Map). The keys for the
Word Map will be the words themselves, and the values will be references to the second type of
Maps (File Maps), which keep the word occurrences in the files. The keys for the File Maps will
be the file names, and the values will be a List of the positions of the associated words in the
corresponding files.
